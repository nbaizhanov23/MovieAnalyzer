In this Repository unfortunately you can view only main.py of my project. Because I had issues with pushing project to Git cause of big size. (Tried to use Git FLS, but unsuccessful). 
So the big size file is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset, so I added these csv files to my project that's why causing issues (more than 700 mb). Github limit is 100mb.

I can share my project with other ways if it is needed, please feel free to contact me.
